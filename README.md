# Programming Projects

## Graphs
- Modify the mst() method of Graph class to find the minimum spanning tree using breadth-first search, rather than depth-first search. In main(), create a graph with 9 vertices and 12 edges and find its minimum spanning tree ([Solution](https://github.com/sevresbabylone/data-structures-in-java/blob/master/Graphs/Adjacency%20Matrix%20Based/Graph.java))

- Modify Graph class to use adjacency lists rather than an adjacency matrix. ([Solution](https://github.com/sevresbabylone/data-structures-in-java/blob/master/Graphs/Adjacency%20List%20Based/Graph.java))

- Create a method to display a connectivity table for a directed graph([Solution](https://github.com/sevresbabylone/data-structures-in-java/blob/master/Graphs/Adjacency%20List%20Based/Graph.java))

- Implement Warshall's algorithm to find the transitive closure for a graph.

- The Knight's Tour is an ancient and famous chess puzzle. The object is to move a knight from one square to another on an otherwise empty chess board until it has visited every square exactly once. Write a program that solves this puzzle using a depth-first-search.

## Weighted Graphs
- Implement Floyd's algorithm
