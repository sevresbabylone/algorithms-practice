# Programming Projects

## Graphs
- Modify the mst() method of Graph class to find the minimum spanning tree using breadth-first search, rather than depth-first search. In main(), create a graph with 9 vertices and 12 edges and find its minimum spanning tree ([Solution](https://github.com/sevresbabylone/data-structures-in-java/blob/master/Graphs/Adjacency%20Matrix%20Based/Graph.java))

- Modify Graph class to use adjacency lists rather than an adjacency matrix. ([Solution](https://github.com/sevresbabylone/data-structures-in-java/blob/master/Graphs/Adjacency%20List%20Based/Graph.java))

- Create a method to display a connectivity table for a directed graph

- Implement Warshall's algorithm to find the transitive closure for a graph.

- The Knight's Tour is an ancient and famous chess puzzle. The object is to move a knight from one square to another on an otherwise empty chess board until it has visited every square exactly once. Write a program that solves this puzzle using a depth-first-search.

## Weighted Graphs
- Modify the shortest path program to print a table of the minimum costs to get from any vertex to any other vertex.

- Implement Floyd's algorithm

- Implement the traveling salesman problem described in the “Intractable Problems” section in this chapter. In spite of its intractability, it will have no trouble solving the problem for small N, say 10 cities or fewer.

- Write a program that discovers and displays all the Hamiltonian cycles of a weighted, non-directed graph
